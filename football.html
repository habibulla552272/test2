      (specifically American football, Arena football, or Canadian football);
      International rules football; rugby league football; and rugby union
      football.[1] These various forms of football share, to varying degrees,
      common origins and are known as "football codes". There are a number of
      references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in
      many different parts of the world.[2][3][4] Contemporary codes of football
      can be traced back to the codification of these games at English public
      schools during the 19th century, itself an outgrowth of medieval
      football.[5][6] The expansion and cultural power of the British Empire
      allowed these rules of football to spread to areas of British influence
      outside the directly controlled Empire.[7] By the end of the 19th century,
      distinct regional codes were already developing: Gaelic football, for
      example, deliberately incorporated the rules of local traditional football
      games in order to maintain their heritage.[8] In 1888, the Football League
      was founded in England, becoming the first of many professional football
      associations. During the 20th century, several of the various kinds of
      football grew to become some of the most popular team sports in the
      world.[9]
