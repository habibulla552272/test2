      The history of baseball can be broken down into various aspects: by era,
      by locale, by organizational-type, game evolution, as well as by political
      and cultural influence. The game evolved from older bat-and-ball games
      already being played in England by the mid-18th century. This game was
      brought by immigrants to North America, where the modern version
      developed. By the late 19th century, baseball was widely recognized as the
      national sport of the United States. Baseball is popular in North America
      and parts of Central and South America, the Caribbean, and East Asia,
      particularly in
