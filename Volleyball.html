      <h3>Volleyball History</h3>
      Volleyball is a team sport in which two teams of six players are separated
      by a net. Each team tries to score points by grounding a ball on the other
      team's court under organized rules.[1] It has been a part of the official
      program of the Summer Olympic Games since Tokyo 1964. Beach volleyball was
      introduced to the programme at the Atlanta 1996 Summer Olympics. The
      adapted version of volleyball at the Summer Paralympic Games is sitting
      volleyball. The complete set of rules is extensive,[2] but play
      essentially proceeds as follows: a player on one of the teams begins a
      'rally' by serving the ball (tossing or releasing it and then hitting it
      with a hand or arm), from behind the back boundary line of the court, over
      the net, and into the receiving team's court.[3] The receiving team must
      not let the ball be grounded within their court. The team may touch the
      ball up to three times to return the ball to the other side of the court,
      but individual players may not touch the ball twice consecutively.[3]
      Typically, the first two touches are used to set up for an attack. An
      attack is an attempt to direct the ball back over the net in such a way
      that the team receiving the ball is unable to pass the ball and continue
      the rally, thus, losing the point. The team that wins the rally is awarded
      a point and serves the ball to start the next rally. A few of the most
      common faults include: causing the ball to touch the ground or floor
      outside the opponents' court or without first passing over the net;
      catching and throwing the ball; double hit: two consecutive contacts with
      the ball made by the same player; four consecutive contacts with the ball
      made by the same team; net foul: touching the net during play; foot fault:
      the foot crosses over the boundary line when serving or under the net when
      a front row player is trying to keep the ball in play. The ball is usually
      played with the hands or arms, but players can legally strike or push
      (short contact) the ball with any part of the body.[4] A number of
      consistent techniques have evolved in volleyball, including spiking and
      blocking (because these plays are made above the top of the net, the
      vertical jump is an athletic skill emphasized in the sport) as well as
      passing, setting, specialized player positions, and offensive and
      defensive structures.[5]
