      A tennis ball is a ball designed for the sport of tennis. Tennis balls are
      fluorescent yellow in organised competitions,[1][2] but in recreational
      play other colors are also used. Tennis balls are covered in a fibrous
      felt, which modifies their aerodynamic properties, and each has a white
      curvilinear oval covering it.

       A tennis ball sliced open to show its rubber bladder Tennis
      balls and internal "blanks" manufactured by Dunlop Slazenger Modern tennis
      balls must conform to certain size, weight, deformation, and bounce
      criteria to be approved for regulation play. The International Tennis
      Federation (ITF) defines the official diameter as 6.54–6.86 cm (2.57–2.70
      inches). Balls must have masses in the range 56.0–59.4 g (1.98–2.10
      ounces). A tennis ball generally has 12 pounds per square inch (80 kPa;
      0.8 atm) more of a nitrogen and oxygen mixture than the sea level ambient
      air pressure.[3][4] Yellow and white are the only colors approved by the
      ITF. Most balls produced are a fluorescent color known as "optic yellow",
      first introduced in 1972 following research demonstrating they were more
      visible on television. What color to call the ball is mildly
      controversial; one poll showed that a little less than half of people
      consider this color yellow, while a slight majority consider it green.[5]
      Tennis balls are filled with air and are surfaced by a uniform
      felt-covered rubber compound. Tennis ball felts comprise wool, nylon, and
      cotton in a mixture surrounding the rubber edge.[6] The felt delays flow
      separation in the boundary layer which reduces aerodynamic drag and gives
      the ball better flight properties.[7][8] Often, the balls will have a
      number in addition to the brand name. This helps distinguish one set of
      balls from another of the same brand on an adjacent court.[9] Tennis balls
      begin to lose their bounce as soon as the tennis ball can is opened.
      Tennis balls lose bounciness because the air inside the ball is pushing
      harder when a can is opened compared to when a ball is packaged. When
      packaged, the pressure in the can equally pushes the ball from the outside
      as the air inside the balls, preserving the pressure inside. When a tennis
      ball is unpackaged, its frequent use allows for air to escape from the
      ball.[10] They can be tested to determine their bounce. Modern regulation
      tennis balls are kept under pressure (approximately two atmospheres) until
      initially used; balls intended for use at high altitudes have a lower
      initial pressure, and inexpensive practice balls are made without internal
      pressurization. A ball is tested for bounce by dropping it from a height
      of 254 cm (100 inches) onto concrete; a bounce between 135 and 147 cm (53
      and 58 inches) is acceptable if taking place at sea-level and 20 °C (68
      °F) with relative humidity of 60%; high-altitude balls have different
      characteristics when tested at sea level.[11] Slower balls A training
      tennis ball The ITF's "Play and Stay" campaign aims to increase tennis
      participation worldwide by improving how starter players are introduced to
      the game. The ITF recommends a progression that focuses on a range of
      slower balls and smaller court sizes to introduce the game to adults and
      children effectively. The slowest balls, marked with red, or using
      half-red felt, are oversized and unpressurized or made from foam rubber.
      The next, in orange, are unpressurized normal-sized balls. The last, with
      green, are half pressured normal sized.[9] History Tennis balls,
      advertisement, 19th century Importation (No. 2) Act 1463 Lawn tennis, as
      the modern game was originally known, was developed in the early 1870s as
      a new version of the courtly game of real tennis. England banned the
      importation of real tennis balls, playing cards, dice, and other goods in
      the Importation (No. 2) Act 1463 (3 Edw. 4. c. 4).[12] In 1480, Louis XI
      of France forbade the filling of tennis balls with chalk, sand, sawdust,
      or earth, and stated that they were to be made of good leather,
      well-stuffed with wool.[13] Other early tennis balls were made by Scottish
      craftsmen from a wool-wrapped stomach of a sheep or goat and tied with
      rope. Those recovered from the hammer-beam roof of Westminster Hall during
      a period of restoration in the 1920s were found to have been manufactured
      from a combination of putty and human hair and were dated to the reign of
      Henry VIII.[14] Other versions, using materials such as animal fur, rope
      made from animal intestines and muscles, and pine wood, were found in
      Scottish castles dating back to the 16th century.[citation needed] In the
      18th century, 1.9 cm (3⁄4 in) strips of wool were wound tightly around a
      nucleus made by rolling several strips into a little ball.[15] String was
      then tied in many directions around the ball, and a white cloth covering
      was sewn around the ball.[citation needed] In the early 1870s, lawn tennis
      arose in Britain through the pioneering efforts of Walter Clopton
      Wingfield and Harry Gem, often using Victorian lawns laid out for croquet.
      Wingfield marketed lawn tennis sets which included rubber balls imported
      from Germany. After Charles Goodyear invented vulcanised rubber, the
      Germans had been most successful in developing air-filled vulcanised
      rubber balls. These were light and coloured grey or red with no covering.
      John Moyer Heathcote suggested and tried the experiment of covering the
      rubber ball with flannel, and by 1882 Wingfield was advertising his balls
      as clad in stout cloth made in Melton Mowbray.[16] Tennis balls were
      initially entirely made of rubber, but they were later refined by using
      flannel and stitching it around the core, which used to be filled with
      rubber. The tennis ball quickly switched to having a hollow core, using
      gas to pressurize the inside. Originally, tennis ball manufacturing was
      done by cutting vulcanized rubber sheets into a shape similar to that of a
      three-leaf clover. Before the formation of the rubber into a sphere (which
      was executed via machinery), chemicals that reacted to produce a gas were
      added to produce pressure into the hollow inside once the sphere was
      assembled. The switch to the modem method of joining two hemispheres was
      done to improve uniformity of wall thickness.[17]
