      <h3>BasketBall History</h3>
      Basketball began with its invention in 1891 in Springfield, Massachusetts,
      by Canadian physical education instructor James Naismith as a less
      injury-prone sport than football. Naismith was a 31-year old graduate
      student when he created the indoor sport to keep athletes indoors during
      the winters.[1] The game became established fairly quickly and grew very
      popular as the 20th century progressed, first in America and then in other
      parts of the world. After basketball became established in American
      colleges, the professional game followed. The American National Basketball
      Association (NBA), established in 1946, grew to a multibillion-dollar
      enterprise by the end of the century, and basketball became an integral
      part of American culture.
